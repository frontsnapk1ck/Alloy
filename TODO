~~~rn~~~
handle large queues
    i like the way rythm does it but that would take some serious work

if a message action fails because of permssions let the user know

make it store the role names in a map somewhere
    maybe switch the server over to json

add in support for more languages

emulate discord
    have a way to do dms
    make it so it can upload files - backend only

make it so that you have more controll over markdown

change the buttons
    make my own

~~~rn-ish~~~
no duplicate building names
log everything

~~~much later~~~
make the bot confirm showing the queue if its too big

set
    rank

make it so that you can see the total amount of xp you've earned

comment everything
    i hate myself

~~~work on next~~~
reaction roles
