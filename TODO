handle large queues
    i like the way rythm does it but that would take some serious work
emulate discord
    have a way to do dms
    make it so it can upload files - backend only


change the buttons
    make my own

~~~rn-ish~~~
no duplicate building names

    rank

make it so that you can see the total amount of xp you've earned
