# Alloy
A moderation and an economy bot that makes your server that much better. also includes a level system and numerous fun commands. this bot is still a work in progress and I ask that you keep that in mind while you are using Alloy. whatever feedback you provide is greatly appreciated. I have big plans for this bot, and I hope that you can see those come to fruition with me. 

Alloy is designed in a manner that allows things to run smoothly and with little to no lag. On top of that, I am always looking for ways to shave even more time off of the processing time.

Alloy is packed full of features,

## Moderation

Alloy has the ability to moderate your server with all the commands you would expect. This is explored in more detail on the next page: Commands. 



## Leveling
Alloy has the ability to track how active people are in your server and give them XP. This system is entirely customizable and can be changed by server administrators



## Economy
Alloy has the ability for you to perform commands to work and to buy buildings. you can even set it up so that when you purchase a building you get awarded a rank. there is so much you can do here just as there is so much to come!


## Configuration
The best part about Alloy, is that you can change almost any setting. There is so much you can change with Alloy in your server, and the list is ever-growing. As new features are added and boring code stuff changes you have more control over what you can do with Alloy.
